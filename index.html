        <p>My name <span class="NameM">Eng.Mohamed Abdiwali Abdullahi</span> and I was born and raised in Somalia. I completed my primary and secondary education there, during which I developed a deep fascination with computers and a strong desire to master their intricacies.</p>

           <br> <p> In 2017, I took my first formal steps into the world of technology by learning computer fundamentals and completing courses in Microsoft Office. This foundational experience solidified my passion for the field and motivated me to pursue further knowledge.</p>
            
           <br><p> In 2020, I embarked on a journey to learn programming languages. Despite facing significant challenges, including limited resources and a lack of mentorship, I remained resilient and committed to my growth. Through relentless perseverance and countless hours of self-study, I successfully overcame these obstacles, ultimately earning the title of Full-Stack Engineer.</p>
            
            <br><p>Currently, I am a computer science student, with aspirations to graduate soon. My journey has taught me the power of resilience and the importance of viewing challenges as opportunities for growth. I am dedicated to expanding my expertise and contributing meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape.  </p>
